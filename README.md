9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

   Steps to set up the debugging

   Step 1: Install Necessary Extensions:
   
   Before you begin, ensure you have the appropriate extensions installed in VS Code for the programming language you are using. For example, if you are coding in Python, you'll need to install the "Python" extension by Microsoft.
   
   Step 2: Set Breakpoints in Your Code:
   
   Navigate to the file where you want to debug.
   
   Click on the left gutter next to the line numbers to set breakpoints. This is where the debugger will pause execution so you can inspect variables and the program's state.
   
   You can set multiple breakpoints across different files if needed.
   
   
   Step 3 : Start Debugging:
   
   Press F5 or go to the Debug view (by clicking on the bug icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window) and select the debug configuration you want to run.
   
   If you don’t have a launch.json configuration file, VS Code can help you create one based on the detected language and environment.
   
   VS Code will launch your program in debug mode and stop at the first breakpoint it encounters.
   
   You can then use debugging controls like Step Over, Step Into, Step Out, and Continue to navigate through your code and inspect variables as needed.

   Key features that are found in VS Code
   
   Multi-Language Support:
   
   -VS Code supports debugging across a wide range of programming languages and frameworks through its extensions. Whether you are developing in Python, JavaScript, C++, or any other supported language, VS Code provides consistent debugging tools and capabilities tailored to each language's ecosystem.

   Intuitive Debugging UI:
   -VS Code's debugging interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. It includes a Debug Sidebar where you can manage breakpoints, inspect variables, navigate the call stack, and control program execution.
   
   -The Debug Console within VS Code allows you to interactively execute code during debugging sessions, view log messages, and evaluate expressions in the context of your program's execution.

   Advanced Breakpoint Management:
   
   -VS Code supports various types of breakpoints beyond the standard line breakpoints. You can set conditional breakpoints that only trigger when specific conditions are met, making it easier to catch edge cases.
   
   -Additionally, VS Code allows you to enable and disable breakpoints selectively, which is useful for focusing on specific sections of your code during debugging without constantly removing and re-adding breakpoints.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Initializing a Repository
    
    -Open VS Code: Start by opening Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
    
    -Open a Folder or Workspace: If you have an existing project folder, open it using VS Code. If not, create a new folder where you want to initialize your Git repository.

    -Initialize Git:
    
    -Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on macOS).
    
    -Type "Git: Initialize Repository" and select it. This initializes a new Git repository in the root of your opened folder or workspace.
    
    -Add Files:
    
    -Start adding files to your project (if not already present).
    
    -Once added, you'll see these files listed in the Source Control view in VS Code (typically on the left-hand side).

    Making Commits
    
    Stage Changes:
    
    -In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changes (new files, modifications, deletions).
    
    -Click on the "+" button next to each file or use the "Stage All Changes" button (represented by a checkmark) to stage all changes.
    
    Commit Changes:
    
    -Once staged, enter a commit message in the text box provided at the top of the Source Control view.
    
    -Press Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on macOS) or click the checkmark icon to commit your changes.
    
    View Commit History:
    
    -To view your commit history, click on the clock icon in the Source Control view. This shows a list of recent commits with their messages.

    Pushing Changes to GitHub
    
    Link to GitHub Repository:
    
    -Before pushing changes to GitHub, ensure you have a GitHub repository created where you want to push your local changes.
    
    -Set Remote Repository:

In VS Code, you can set the remote repository URL using the Command Palette:

-Type "Git: Add Remote" and provide the URL of your GitHub repository.

-Alternatively, you can add it manually using Git commands (git remote add origin <remote_url>).
Push Changes:

-After staging and committing your changes, you can push them to GitHub:

-Use the Command Palette and type "Git: Push" to push your committed changes to the remote repository.

-Alternatively, you can push changes using the terminal in VS Code (git push origin main or git push origin master, depending on your branch name).

Verify on GitHub:

-Visit your GitHub repository page to verify that your changes have been successfully pushed.
